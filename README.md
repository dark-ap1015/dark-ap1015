# About Me:
Hi, I'm Aaren Pan. I am currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Pennsylvania State University. I have an extensive technical background, having experience as a Software Developer for Penn State's largest hackathon organization, HackPSU, as well as being a Software Automation Tester.

Besides technical experience, I've worked in the restaurant industry for over 6 years, held multiple leadership positions–for instance, Communications Chair for Penn State's Fuzhou Student Association (FJSA), and carry with me a strong work ethic and collaboration + communication skills.

Check out my GitLab (I am under NDA from my prev. internship, therefore, the project is private): [![GitLab](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitLab-FC6D26?style=for-the-badge&logo=gitlab&logoColor=white)](https://gitlab.com/dark-ap1015)
