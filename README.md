# About Me:
Hi, I'm Aaren Pan. I am currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Pennsylvania State University. I have an extensive technical background, having experience as a Software Developer for Penn State's largest hackathon organization, HackPSU, as well as being a Software Development Engineer in Test Intern for Summer 2025.

Besides technical experience, I've worked in the restaurant industry for over 6 years, held multiple leadership positions such as being the Communications Chair for Penn State's Fuzhou Student Association (FJSA), and carry with me a strong work ethic and collaboration + communication skills.

**My biggest strength is my determination and perserverence no matter the obstacle. I will get the job done and I'll get it done with 150% of my effort.**
